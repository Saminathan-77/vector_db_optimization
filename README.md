\# High Performance Vector Database

\#\# Objective  
Develop a high-performance vector database that loads data from Google Cloud Storage (GCS) and performs K-nearest neighbors (KNN) search. The solution should be scalable, economical, and capable of handling a high number of queries per second.

\#\# Overview  
This project implements a vector database that retrieves datasets from GCS, performs KNN search using cosine similarity (dot product), and returns the top k indices of the dataset that are most similar to the query vector. The solution includes the following key components:

\- Data storage and retrieval from GCS  
\- KNN search using cosine similarity  
\- API to handle KNN search requests

\#\# Optimizations  
\#\#\# 1\. Asynchronous Operations  
\- Used asynchronous functions (\`asyncio\`, \`aiohttp\`) to handle I/O-bound tasks such as downloading datasets from GCS. This reduces the wait time for I/O operations, leading to better overall performance.

\#\#\# 2\. Caching  
\- Implemented caching for datasets to avoid repeated downloads from GCS. This significantly reduces latency for subsequent requests for the same dataset.

\#\#\# 3\. Multi-threading  
\- Used multi-threading to download and load datasets concurrently. This improves the performance by utilizing multiple CPU cores, thus speeding up data processing.

\#\#\# 4\. Multi-processing  
\- Employed multi-processing to parallelize the KNN search computation. This leverages multiple CPU cores to handle computationally intensive tasks, thereby improving query handling performance.

\#\# Architecture  
\#\#\# Data Retrieval  
\- Datasets are stored in GCS and are retrieved on demand.  
\- Data is temporarily stored in local files to facilitate processing.

\#\#\# KNN Search  
\- Vectors are normalized to unit length.  
\- Dot product is used to compute the similarity between the query vector and dataset vectors.  
\- The top k vectors with the highest dot product values are returned as the nearest neighbors.

\#\#\# API  
\- The API is built using Quart, a Python web framework.  
\- The API provides endpoints for KNN search, supporting both synchronous and asynchronous operations.

\#\# Learnings  
\#\#\# 1\. Asynchronous Programming  
\- Gained experience with asynchronous programming in Python, particularly with \`asyncio\` and \`aiohttp\`. This improved my understanding of handling I/O-bound tasks efficiently.

\#\#\# 2\. Caching Mechanisms  
\- Learned how to implement caching to enhance performance by reducing redundant data retrieval operations.

\#\#\# 3\. Concurrent Programming  
\- Explored multi-threading and multi-processing to parallelize tasks, resulting in significant performance improvements for CPU-bound operations.

\#\# Potential Optimizations  
\#\#\# 1\. Batch Processing  
\- Implement batch processing of KNN search requests to handle multiple queries concurrently, which could further enhance throughput.

\#\#\# 2\. Advanced Caching Strategies  
\- Implement more sophisticated caching strategies, such as LRU (Least Recently Used) cache, to manage memory usage efficiently.

\#\#\# 3\. Optimized Data Structures  
\- Explore the use of more advanced data structures like KD-Trees or Ball Trees for faster KNN search, especially for high-dimensional data.

\#\#\# 4\. Distributed Computing  
\- Implement distributed computing to scale the solution horizontally, allowing it to handle larger datasets and more concurrent requests.

\#\# Benchmarking  
To benchmark the performance of the KNN search API, use the provided benchmarking script. This script tests the API by simulating multiple concurrent requests and measures the success rate, total processing time, and average response time per request.
